# JSONL-Lab-issues
Issue only repo for my JSONL-Lab VSCode extension

Report any bugs and request features here.
I created this extension only really to fill an empty weekend with an experiment, but if you find it useful and find something doesn't work like you think it should, or if you've got an idea for an improvement or cool feature, let me know and I'll look at it on my next empty weekend.
